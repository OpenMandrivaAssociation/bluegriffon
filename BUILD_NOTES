here's a few general notes for anyone else trying to build this app.

    1. 	Don't bother to enable lto. It used to work for gcc but post gcc-7.3 it no longer works due to an internal complier error. A bug has been filed upstream.
    2. 	If you want to build with the clang compiler do not enable the clang-plugin or lto as currently it won't build with either enabled. See below about the clang plugin.
    3.	There are some patches which help the build of the clang plugin however although it compiles it fails on linking with a missing symbol. 
	The patches in the 10,20,30 etc series are those that need to be applied to build the plugin.
